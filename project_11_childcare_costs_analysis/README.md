# Analysis of U.S. Childcare Costs: Trends, Disparities, and Policy Recommendations  

## Description  
This project analyzes U.S. childcare costs across states and counties from 2008 to 2018. It identifies national trends, regional disparities, and the socioeconomic impact of rising childcare expenses on labor force participation, particularly among women in low- to middle-income households.  

## Tools/Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis.  
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard for visual exploration and analysis.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and summary statistics.  
- **Excel**: Initial data source and review.  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Loaded the dataset from `nationaldatabaseofchildcareprices.xlsx` (34,567 rows, 227 columns).  
   - Identified key columns, including state/county details, childcare prices, and socioeconomic indicators.  
   - Handled missing data, particularly imputed values marked with flags.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyzed trends in childcare costs over time.  
   - Compared regional disparities by state and county.  
   - Examined the correlation between childcare costs and labor force participation rates.  

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:  
   - Designed a Tableau dashboard to allow users to explore:  
     - National and regional childcare trends.  
     - Socioeconomic indicators like unemployment and income.  
     - Key insights through interactive maps, graphs, and tooltips.  

4. **Written Report and Recommendations**:  
   - Summarized findings and policy recommendations based on the analysis.  

## Results  
- **Childcare Costs**: Increased by **15-20% nationally** over the decade, with the sharpest rise from **2012 to 2015**.  
- **Regional Disparities**:  
   - Northeast and West Coast states report the highest costs, exceeding $15,000 annually for toddlers.  
   - Midwestern and Southern states have lower childcare costs, averaging between $8,000 and $10,000.  
- **Impact on Labor Force Participation**: High childcare costs correlate with reduced workforce participation among women, particularly in lower-income households.  

## Policy Recommendations  
1. Expand childcare subsidies for low-income families.  
2. Promote employer-supported childcare through tax incentives.  
3. Invest in early education programs to reduce long-term economic disparities.

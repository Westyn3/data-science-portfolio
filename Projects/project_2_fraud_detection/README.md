## Description  
This project uses machine learning models to detect fraudulent financial transactions. By analyzing patterns in data, the project identifies anomalies and flags suspicious transactions.

## Tools/Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Methodology  
1. Cleaned and combined credit card, online retail, and mobile transaction datasets.  
2. Implemented classification models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
3. Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and AUC scores.  

## Results  
The Random Forest model achieved an AUC score of 0.98, effectively detecting fraudulent activities.

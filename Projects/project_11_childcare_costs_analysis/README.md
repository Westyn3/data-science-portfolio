# Analysis of U.S. Childcare Costs: Trends, Disparities, and Policy Recommendations  

## Description  
This project explores U.S. childcare costs from 2008 to 2018, highlighting trends, regional disparities, and their socioeconomic impacts. It identifies the relationship between childcare affordability and labor force participation, focusing on insights for policymakers and families.  

## Tools/Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.  
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for regional cost visualization.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and transformation.  
- **Excel**: Source data preparation.

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Loaded the `childcare_costs.xlsx` dataset.  
   - Cleaned missing values, handled data flags, and preprocessed relevant variables.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Identified key trends in childcare cost increases.  
   - Examined regional disparities using summary statistics and visualizations.  

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:  
   - Designed a Tableau dashboard to provide interactive exploration of costs over time, regional trends, and correlations with socioeconomic indicators.  

4. **Report Development**:  
   - Documented findings in both a detailed final report and a summarized executive version.

## Results  
- **National Trends**: Childcare costs increased by **21%** over the decade, with the sharpest rise between 2012 and 2015.  
- **Regional Disparities**:  
   - Northeast and West Coast states had costs exceeding $15,000 annually for toddlers.  
   - Midwest and Southern regions remained more affordable.  
- **Labor Force Impact**: Rising childcare costs negatively affected womenâ€™s labor force participation rates, particularly in lower-income households.

# Automotive Data Analysis and Prediction

## Description  
This project explores relationships between vehicle specifications (horsepower, weight, fuel efficiency) and builds a predictive model for fuel efficiency.

## Tools/Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Methodology  
1. Cleaned and preprocessed automotive data.  
2. Explored relationships between features using heatmaps and scatter plots.  
3. Built a regression model to predict fuel efficiency (mpg).  

## Results  
The regression model highlighted weight and horsepower as key factors negatively impacting fuel efficiency.

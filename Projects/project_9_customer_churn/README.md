# Customer Churn Prediction for Telecom

## Description  
This project builds a predictive machine learning model to identify customers likely to churn from a telecom service provider. By analyzing usage patterns, demographics, and billing behavior, the project offers actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

## Tools/Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and prepared features for modeling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualized usage patterns and billing trends across churned and retained customers.  
3. **Model Development**: Implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting models.  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics.  

## Results  
- The Gradient Boosting model achieved **85% accuracy** with a strong ROC-AUC score, successfully identifying high-risk churn customers.

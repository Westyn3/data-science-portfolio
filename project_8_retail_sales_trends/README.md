## Description  
This project uses time series analysis to model and predict monthly retail sales trends in the United States. The analysis identifies key patterns, trends, and disruptions affecting retail sales.

## Tools/Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, Statsmodels  
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)  
- Matplotlib  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation**: Loaded and cleaned monthly retail sales data, removing inconsistencies and missing values.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized retail sales trends over time to identify seasonal patterns and major disruptions.  
3. **Modeling**: Applied ARIMA models for time series forecasting and optimized hyperparameters.  
4. **Evaluation**: Compared forecasted sales with actual trends to evaluate model accuracy.  

## Results  
The ARIMA model successfully predicted retail sales trends, highlighting key economic disruptions such as the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19's impact on sales.
